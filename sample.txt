\f0\b\fs24 \cf2 Dr. Sits (Tech Policy Expert):
\f1\b0  Thank you. I believe the primary interest should be developing AI solutions that address local challenges rather than importing models designed for Western contexts. In many developing countries, we need AI that works with limited infrastructure, multilingual populations, and different societal structures.\

\f0\b Professor friii (AI Researcher):
\f1\b0  I agree with Dr. Amara. We're seeing a concerning "AI divide" where developing nations risk becoming mere consumers of AI rather than creators. Our focus should be on building local AI talent and research capacity so countries can develop sovereign AI capabilities tailored to their specific needs.\

\f0\b Minister Tola (Government Representative):
\f1\b0  From a policy perspective, we're interested in AI that drives economic growth while ensuring equity. Many of our countries are dealing with challenges in healthcare, agriculture, and education where AI could make tremendous impact. But we need frameworks that protect our citizens' data and ensure these technologies don't exacerbate existing inequalities.}
